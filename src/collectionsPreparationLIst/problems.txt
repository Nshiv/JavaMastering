Problem 1: Remove Duplicates from a List
Write a method that accepts a List of integers and removes any duplicate
elements from the list, keeping only the distinct values.

Problem 2: List Intersection
Write a method that accepts two Lists of integers and returns a
new List that contains only the elements that are common between the two input lists.

Problem 3: List Partitioning
Write a method that accepts a List of integers and partitions it into two lists:
 one containing all the even numbers and the other containing all the odd numbers.

Problem 4: List Sorting
Write a method that accepts a List of integers and sorts the elements in ascending order
 using a sorting algorithm of your choice (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, etc.).

Problem 5: List Rotation
Write a method that accepts a List of integers and an integer value representing
the number of positions to rotate the list. Implement the rotation operation by
shifting the elements to the right (or left) by the specified number of positions.
